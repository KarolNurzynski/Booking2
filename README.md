# Booking2

This is a clone of booking.com service (more or less;)

The purpose of this exercise was to (in comparison with workshop 2_1):
- divide repsonsibilty between entities (which store data temporary) and DAO classes responsible for sql queries(which perform sql queries using entity classes)
- create a class resposbile for connection to DataBase (DBUtil.class)
